I'm Santiago Veintimilla, data scientist from Ecuador travelling around the globe.
I'm very interested in the development of Blockchain related technologies and how they can change
the world. I am focused on the impact of soft skills within data related positions. 
This is a personal repository of non company-related projects. 
If interested please reach out to santiagoveintimilla@gmail.com, cheers!
